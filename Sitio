I have a property with several mineral springs totaling on average 640,000 m² of rainforest , these 90,000 m² exploited

My intention is to introduce polycultures in forest cover areas using artificial lighting to good agricultural practice

The dimensioning of the area to be used would be on average 45,000 m² maintenance and cost of the total farmland

Profitability would be directly linked to the local amount of manpower to be used

With the implementation of apiary

Think about it !!!
